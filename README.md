BV.IO 2014
==========

Resources
---------
Here are some tools and data sources you can use in your hack, but don't feel restricted to just these.  Feel free to use whatever technology or information you can get your hands on!  If you're looking for some inspiration or have your eyes on the Customer Choice Award, checkout out some of these [ideas](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nexus-public-artifacts/bvio2014/bvio-ideas.pdf) provided by our clients.

Sample Applications
-------------------
Most APIs will have examples for you to check out or download, but we've provided [a few samples](sample) in this very repo.  Use these to jumpstart your brainstorming or to bootstrap your hack quickly.

BV Conversations API
--------------------
The Conversations API provides access to UGC data in the form of Reviews, Questions, Answers, Stories, Comments, and Profiles, as well as product catalog and statistical data, and allows submission of some of these types of data as well.  
* You'll need an API key to get access to a client's data.  Contact our Key Distributors and let them know which client you'll be hacking on.
* If you're interested in submitting content as part of your project, let us know and we'll hook you up with a staging key instead!
* The keys provided to you are rate limited, so don't be surprised if you run into trouble trying to download the entirety of Walmart's data set over _many_ requests.  Instead, why not check out the provided client data below?
* Check out the [documentation](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/docs/read/conversations/) and [samples](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/apis/conversations/tutorials/) to get started!

## Layout of the Data Tar Files

There are two types of files.

 - resourceType.txt : Each line of this file, is one piece of JSON content from the [BV Conversations Api](https://developer.bazaarvoice.com/docs/read/conversations/).
 - resourceType_ids.txt : A list of all the Ids of that data.  This file is an artifact of the data extraction process.

Note, the contents of the files should be considered _un-ordered_.  Also, a few of our clients have a lot of data (Bestbuy and Macy's), so we'll have a few flash drives available at the registration table with the data preloaded, for your convenience.

To bootstrap your progress, there is a sample Java program that can read the the supplied data [here](https://github.com/bazaarvoice/bvio2014/tree/master/sample/tarball).
