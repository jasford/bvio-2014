## FeedMagnet Instructions

The FeedMagnet SDK enables you to pull real-time content from social channels like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. You can browse the full list of sources available [here](http://www.feedmagnet.com/product/#aggregate). Content can be filtered for relevance and even moderated if you want to hand-pick the best social posts.

FeedMagnet consists of a browser-based UI and a JavaScript SDK. The UI enables you to set up sources and filters and to moderate content. The SDK lets you build things to display the content.

### Content sources for hackathon

There are two content groups already set up on the `bvio.feedmagnet.com` instance for the hackathon:

1. `bvio` – Twitter and Instagram searches for "#bvio2014"
2. `hackathon` – Twitter and Instagram searches for "#bvhackathon"

If you want to add more sources, ask one of the hackathon organizers for a login to [bvio.feedmagnet.com](http://bvio.feedmagnet.com).
